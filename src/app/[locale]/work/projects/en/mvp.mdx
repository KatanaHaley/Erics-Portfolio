## MVP

- role: "Jason Webster"

In a poignant short film that delves into the harrowing reality of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), we follow the life of a man whose past as a once-promising athlete now leads him down a dark path. CTE, a neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated head injuries, slowly erodes his memory, behavior, and emotional control, pushing him to the brink of isolation.

The film paints a raw portrait of the man’s internal struggle as his cognitive decline worsens. His once-loving family, unable to comprehend the depth of his suffering, becomes distant. Misunderstood and stigmatized, he faces rejection from those he loves the most. His wife and children grow frustrated with his outbursts, confusion, and violent tendencies, which stem from the disease. The man, unable to explain what’s happening to him, finds himself spiraling further into despair.

As his condition worsens, the film explores themes of loss—of self, relationships, and identity. It shows how CTE can lead not just to physical deterioration, but emotional and psychological fragmentation, leaving the person at the mercy of an unforgiving world. The man’s battle is not just with his brain, but with the people who once stood by him, now strangers unable or unwilling to see past his symptoms.
